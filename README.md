# Camera-Feature-Extraction
* Used to extract features of cameras from corresponding images (help with camera model identification)<br>
* In order to run the code, download the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/sp-society-camera-model-identification/data) first, then unzip it and put subdirectories in it into the data directory.

#### Collected features:
* fingerprints
* normalized central moments
* cross correlations
* linear pattern correlations
* block covariances
* (did not collect radial distortions because it's hard to collect merely from images sampled)

#### TODO:
* visualize the features
