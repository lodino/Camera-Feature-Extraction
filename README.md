# Camera-Feature-Extraction
Used to extract features of cameras from corresponding images (help with camera model identification)

#### Collected features:
* fingerprints
* normalized central moments
* cross correlations
* linear pattern correlations
* block covariances
* (did not collect radial distortions because it's hard to collect merely from images sampled)

#### TODO:
* apply PCA to extracted features
* visualize the features
